# TranslinkScraper

TranslinkScraper scrapes the images of traffic cameras from the City of Vancouver's Open Data page: 
https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/web-cam-url-links/information/

The images will be saved to a folder in the directory called "/images" and from there can either be viewed or uploaded to a data bucket.
This script was developed for a hackathon to fight congestion in the city of Vancouver. It is free to use by anyone who would like to.
